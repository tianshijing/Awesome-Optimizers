### Adding New Optimizers

To add a new optimizer, follow these steps:

Fork the repository.
Create a new branch for your optimizer.
Implement the optimizer following the Style (We currently only provide an implementation using PyTorch, but of course, if needed, we can also provide an implementation using TensorFlow.).
Write tests to ensure the optimizer works correctly.
Update the documentation to include the new optimizer.
Commit your changes and push to your fork.
Submit a pull request.

### Improving Documentation

Improving documentation is a valuable contribution. If you find areas that are unclear or could be improved, please submit a pull request with your changes.
