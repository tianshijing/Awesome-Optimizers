## Introduction

**In the domain of machine learning, the selection of an appropriate optimizer is of equal significance to the architectural design of the model itself.**

We have meticulously assembled a compendium of preeminent optimizers from the recent scholarly landscape, complemented by lucid roadmaps and pedagogical tutorial notebooks. Our insights, garnered from active engagement in pertinent projects, further enrich this repository. We warmly welcome contributions to this project, including the latest optimizers, tutorial notebooks, or any other valuable resources that can benefit researchers in our community.

**Abstract**  This paper delves into the interplay between vision backbones and optimizers, unvealing an inter-dependent phenomenon termed backbone-optimizer coupling bias (BOCB). We observe that canonical CNNs, such as VGG and ResNet, exhibit a marked co-dependency with SGD families, while recent architectures like ViTs and ConvNeXt share a tight coupling with the adaptive learning rate ones. We further show that BOCB can be introduced by both optimizers and certain backbone designs and may significantly impact the pre-training and downstream fine-tuning of vision models. Through in-depth empirical analysis, we summarize takeaways on recommended optimizers and insights into robust vision backbone architectures. We hope this work can inspire the community to question long-held assumptions on backbones and optimizers, stimulate further explorations, and thereby contribute to more robust vision systems. The source code and models are publicly available.

**Backbone-Optimizer Coupling Bias (BOCB)** is a phenomenon we observed during the bench-marking, which arises from the intricate interplay between the design principles of vision backbones and the inherent properties of optimizers.

</p>

This classification helps in understanding the underlying principles and applications of these optimizers.

## Recommended Hyperparameter Settings
<details>
<summary><strong>Click to Expand</strong></summary>

Herein, we present a set of recommended hyperparameters for use under various visual backbone scenarios. Please note that these suggestions are based on extensive research and empirical findings, and should be considered a useful starting point rather than a one-size-fits-all solution. As with any machine learning application, the optimal hyperparameters may vary depending on the specific characteristics of your dataset and the computational resources available to you. We encourage practitioners to use these recommendations as a foundation and to further fine-tune them to suit their unique requirements and constraints.
